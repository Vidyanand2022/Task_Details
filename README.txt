Requirements:
1. Provide the architecture for an automated process to perform testing and deployment of data assets (tables, views, etc) using a database of your choice. Include Tech Stack and CI/CD approach.

- Please download 'Code_Challenge_Requirement_1_2' PPT file from an email attachment and refer slides 1,2 and 3.


2. Describe how can you enable a cross-functional team to discover data assets within a datalake.

- Please download 'Code_Challenge_Requirement_1_2' PPT file from an email attachment and refer slides 4 and 5.

 
3. You are part of a team developing a new datalake. The Data Engineers implemented a process to retrieve data from several sources. Your task is to create a method to identify PII data coming from 
   these sources and restrict access to the data only to the auditors. How would you implement this process? Describe the process using the cloud provider of your choice.

- Please download 'Code_Challenge_Requirement_3' word file from an email attachment. This document describes detail level steps to acheive above mentioned task.

Bonus points:
â€¢ Represent the architecture in point 1 using dbt.
- Please download 'dbt_git_snowflake_process' word file from an email attachment. In this document I have made an attempt to explain all the required steps to acheive this task.
